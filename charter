Goals:
1. To adhere well as a group, respecting each member, and supporting each member by
working together to accomplish the goals listed below and adhering to this charter.
2. To gain a more intimate knowledge of the software life cycle by working as a group to
develop a quality product worth an “A”.
3. To attain practical knowledge and experience of what it means to be a software engineer
and to familiarize ourselves with the methods and practices that are required to pull
together a team project.


Ground Rules:
Meetings:

1. Length of meetings:
All meetings will be given a minimum of 15 minutes to ensure that all members voices can be heard.
The group can plan additional meetings including two or more members at will.
If a meeting extends past its planned time then members may leave at will but shall alert the other members of their exit.

2. Missing a meeting:
Acceptable justification of a missed meeting includes, but is not limited to: injury, illness,
family emergency, work, conflicting class schedule, or death (yourself or other). 
If a meeting is missed for any other reason, the affected group members will decide as to whether the 
reason for missing the meeting is acceptable or in need of disciplinary action through a majority vote.
Two meetings missed without a valid excuse will result in a minor offence.
All subsequent unexcused missed meetings will result in an additional major offence.

3. Tardiness to meetings:
If an individual arrives at a meeting after the start time and meaningful conversation has already began then
any member may suggest that the member shall be marked as having "missed" half of a meeting and shall be subject
to disciplinary action as defined in the "Missing a meeting" section above.
If the member arrives over halfway through the meeting then they shall be marked as having "missed" a full meeting.

4. Phone use, food and drinks during meetings:
It is okay to occasionally text during meetings or take a phone call if you are receiving one.
If someone is making calls, receiving many calls, or texting excessively, then group members
may take a vote to decide if the individual shall receive a minor offence for their behaviour.
No food, drugs, or alcohol during meetings, use of aforementioned items will result in a minor offence.


Work Norms:
1. Work Assignments:
a. Sprint Commitment:
In sprint planning meetings each user will be assigned roughly the same amount of work unless they volunteer for more.
Each week each person can be expected to complete at least two small stories worth of work.

b. Time Commitment Exemptions:
If someone has an appropriate reason to not be able to do as much work then they will be assigned less work. 
Needing a work exemption for more than 1 sprint will result in a minor group offense for all subsequent exemptions.

2. Work Habits:
Members of the group may work at any time that is convienent for them so long as it reasonably fits into the assigned deadlines.


Policy Creation
1. In order to add new policies or make any policy modifications to this charter there must be a majority of group members who agree to add the policy to this charter


Group Communication and Interaction:
1. Communication Tools: 
Group members are expected to use discord as the main method communicate with each other. The UWM email may be
used as a form of backup communication when members are unable to use discord.

2. Communication Expectations:
Whenever a group member completes a portion of the project then they shall post a message detailing their work.
Members may query other members for progress updates, failure to respond to these updates within one work day shall
result in a minor group offence. 
If they reply within 24 hours then there will be no offence even if they forgot to post about completing work.

3. Meeting Attendance:
Members shall notify the group of a meeting absence/tardiness at least 30 minutes prior to
any meeting. Failure to do so shall result in a minor group offense.

4. Group Structure:
Meeting Leader: Makes sure all meetings are on topic and that all individuals voices are heard
Recorder: Posts recaps of all meetings and records offenses
Github Manager: Manages the groups repositorys to ensure that proper git procedures are being followed.

5. Decision Making:
Any decision which needs to be made involving the group members may be done through majority vote.
A majority vote shall begin whenever a group member raises an objection to another group members suggestion.
An anonymous form will be sent for all members to fill out in order to reach a majority vote decision.
If in a meeting involving at least 2/3 of the group, then the present group members have 5 minutes to fill out the form.
Majority votes done outside of meetings must be filled out by all group members within 24 hours.
If a vote affects only a portion of the group, then a decision may be made if 2/3 of the affected members agree to the decision.
Any member may override a partial vote in order to turn it into a whole group vote at any time.
Failure to fill out majority vote forms within the given time period will result in a minor group offence.

6. Group Decisions on Delegation:
Each group member may volunteer, or volunteer others, for any responsibility.
If anyone opposes this decision then the team shall take time to voice all interested
individuals voices before entering a majority vote on the final delegation of the responsibility.



Disciplinary Procedures:
1. Regarding disciplinary actions:
Any disciplinary action to be administered can be overridden by group conscience, if
decided by a majority vote.


2. Disciplinary Log:
The note taker will be responsible for logging any information on offenses committed by
any member. This report will be sent out with the meeting notes every week so each
member knows where they stand. This can also be covered in our 15 minute weekly standup. 


3. Minor Group Offence:
A minor group offence can occur for breaking indicated statutes of the charter. Minor
offences require the offender to recognize their mistake and quickly rectify this along with fixing 
any other potentially cascading problems. This can include arriving late without notifying team memebers,
forgetting to meet a deadline or just forgetting to push their parts to contribute. 


4. Major Group Offence:
A major group offence can occur by breaking indicated statutes of the charter, or for
accumulation of 3 or more minor offences. Major offences require that the offender has already 
committed (no pun intended) multiple minor offences with this offence carrying more weight. This can 
include deleting any valuable parts of the project, malicious intent, or outright sabotage of someones area
or the whole project. They are expected to acknowledge their mistake. 


5. Punishment and Dismissal:
A group member committing enough minor and major offences will be discussed with a notified Professor Rock
and will potentially be dismissed from the group. 


We, the team named Pogchamps agree with the Group Charter and will try our best to uphold it.
