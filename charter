Availability for meeting expectations

Ground Rules:
Meetings:

1. Length of meetings:
The purpose of meetings is to establish communication and give direction to the project.
15-minute online meeting will be held on Tuesday at 9:00 p.m.
Meetings once a week should be enough unless it is decided by the group that additional meetings should be scheduled. 
This communication should take place through the Discord group. 
It is understood that if a meeting takes too long, members may have to leave for work obligations. 
This type of situation will not constitute and offense.

2. Missing a meeting:
An occasional missing of a meeting can be accepted. 
If however an individual repeatedly misses a meeting without good cause, some disciplinary action may have to be taken.
Acceptable justification of a missed meeting includes, but is not limited to: injury, illness,
family emergency, work, conflicting class schedule, or death (yourself or other). 
If a meeting is missed for any other reason, the affected group members will decide as to
whether the reason for missing the meeting is acceptable or in need of disciplinary action.
Two meetings missed without Discord valid excuse will result in a minor offence. 
Three will result in a major offence.

3. Tardiness to meetings:
A person being obviously late for a meeting and not fitting the structure of "on time" shall
be given over to disciplinary action as described in minor offence. 
On time means the time the meeting is scheduled to start (9:00pm on Tuesday). 
If an individual arrives at a meeting after the start time and the meeting has yet to get into 
purposeful conversation then it may be overlooked. 
However if there is no good excuse for being late and the meeting is clearly underway when the 
individual arrives then at the end of the meeting it will be discussed as to whether disciplinary 
action will have to be taken. 
Being late to a meeting more than once constitutes a minor offence. 
Records of being late will be recorded by group note taker.

4. Phone use, food and drinks during meetings:
Not be too much to ask the outside phone calls unless they are perceived to be an emergency.
The taking of phone calls will come into question if they are taken often during meetings and
the offender will be politely asked to discontinue. 
If the behavior continues, it will be discussed among the group as to whether it should be a minor offense. 
Checking a text message will be allowed as well as sending an occasional text to let someone know you
are in a meeting and will get back to them. 
However social texting will not be allowed and the offender will again be politely asked to stop. 
If the behavior continues it will be discussed among the group as to whether it should be a minor offence.
No food during meetings.
No limit of drink during meeting.

Group Communication and Interaction:

1. Communication Tools: 
    Group members are expected to use discord as the main method communicate with each other. The UWM email may be
    used as a form of backup communication when members are unable to use discord.

2. Communication Expectations:
    All of the group members are expected to be present at the weekly stand up which will occur on Tuesdays at 21:00 CST
    in Discord for 15 minutes. Any other communication including more than one and up to all of the group members outside
    of this time will be done as necessary through Discord and decided on by the members involved.

3. Meeting Attendance:
    All of the group members are required to attend the weekly stand up that is held on Tuesdays. Members are expected to
    report any circumstances that would prevent them from participating in the weekly stand up 24 hours prior to the meeting
    time in a non-emergency scenario. Not following these meeting attendance guidelines and missing two meetings will result
    in a minor group offense.

4. Group Structure:
    TODO: Group Structure to be decided. Will be adhering closely to the Scrum structure for this.

5. Decision Making:
    Any decisions which need to be made about the project, project direction or disciplinary
    action will be made by a majority vote. Any decisions about delegation will be covered in
    part six.

6. Group Decisions on Delegation:
    The delegation of responsibilities to group members will be decided in the following
    fashion. The responsibilities will be discussed and decided on as a group decision. Then
    each group member has the opportunity to volunteer for the task he may want. If a group
    member does not volunteer for a task, they will be assigned one by Yoda. If a group
    member feels the portion of responsibility is unfair, they may voice their concern and
    state a reason why. If a majority of the group feels this member is correct, the
    responsibilities will be reformed and the delegation process will start again.
