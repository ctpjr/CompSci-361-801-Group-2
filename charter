Group Communication and Interaction:

1. Communication Tools: 
  Group members are expected to use discord as the main method communicate with each other. The UWM email may be
  used as a form of backup communication when members are unable to use discord.

2. Communication Expectations:
  All of the group members are expected to be present at the weekly stand up which will occur on Tuesdays at 21:00 CST
  in Discord for 15 minutes. Any other communication including more than one and up to all of the group members outside
  of this time will be done as necessary through Discord and decided on by the members involved.

3. Meeting Attendance:
  All of the group members are required to attend the weekly stand up that is held on Tuesdays. Members are expected to
  report any circumstances that would prevent them from participating in the weekly stand up 24 hours prior to the meeting
  time in a non-emergency scenario. Not following these meeting attendance guidelines and missing two meetings will result
  in a minor group offense.

4. Group Structure:
  TODO: Group Structure to be decided. Will be adhering closely to the Scrum structure for this.

5. Decision Making:
  Any decisions which need to be made about the project, project direction or disciplinary
  action will be made by a majority vote. Any decisions about delegation will be covered in
  part six.

6. Group Decisions on Delegation:
  The delegation of responsibilities to group members will be decided in the following
  fashion. The responsibilities will be discussed and decided on as a group decision. Then
  each group member has the opportunity to volunteer for the task he may want. If a group
  member does not volunteer for a task, they will be assigned one by Yoda. If a group
  member feels the portion of responsibility is unfair, they may voice their concern and
  state a reason why. If a majority of the group feels this member is correct, the
  responsibilities will be reformed and the delegation process will start again.
