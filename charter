The POG Champs




Work Norms:
1. Work Assignments:
a. Sprint Commitment:
In sprint planning meetings each user will be assigned roughly the same amount of work.
Each week each person can be expected to complete at least two small stories worth of work.

b. Time Commitment Exemptions:
If someone has an appropriate reason to not be able to do as much work then they will be assigned less work. 
Needing a work exemption for more than 1 sprint will result in a minor group offense for all subsequent exemptions.

2. Work Habits:
Members of the group may work at any time that is convienent for them so long as it reasonably fits into the assigned deadlines.
