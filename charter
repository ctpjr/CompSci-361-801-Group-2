Goals:
1. To adhere well as a group, respecting each member, and supporting each member by
working together to accomplish the goals listed below and adhering to this charter.
2. To gain a more intimate knowledge of the software life cycle by working as a group to
develop a quality product worth an “A”.
3. To attain practical knowledge and experience of what it means to be a software engineer
and to familiarize ourselves with the methods and practices that are required to pull
together a team project.




Disciplinary Procedures:
1. Regarding disciplinary actions:
Any disciplinary action to be administered can be overridden by group conscience, if
decided by a majority vote.


2. Disciplinary Log:
The note taker will be responsible for logging any information on offenses committed by
any member. This report will be sent out with the meeting notes every week so each
member knows where they stand. This can also be covered in our 15 minute weekly standup. 


3. Minor Group Offence:
A minor group offence can occur for breaking indicated statutes of the charter. Minor
offences require the offender to recognize their mistake and quickly rectify this along with fixing 
any other potentially cascading problems. This can include arriving late without notifying team memebers,
forgetting to meet a deadline or just forgetting to push their parts to contribute. 


4. Major Group Offence:
A major group offence can occur by breaking indicated statutes of the charter, or for
accumulation of 3 or more minor offences. Major offences require that the offender has already 
committed (no pun intended) multiple minor offences with this offence carrying more weight. This can 
include deleting any valuable parts of the project, malicious intent, or outright sabotage of someones area
or the whole project. They are expected to acknowledge their mistake. 


5. Punishment and Dismissal:
A group member committing enough minor and major offences will be discussed with a notified Professor Rock
and will potentially be dismissed from the group. 


We, the team named Pogchamps agree with the Group Charter and will try our best to uphold it.
